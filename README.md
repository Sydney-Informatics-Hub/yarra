# Yarra at Sydney Univeristy

The [Yarra Framework](https://yarra-framework.org/overview/) is a collection of software tools to support the development and clinical translation of novel reconstruction techniques for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
It uses a "Client-Server" model, where the Server machine does all the heavy processing. The server must run on linux, and the clients must be windows. This guide details how to setup a Server on the Ronin Research Cloud 
(a front-end to AWS) configured at the University of Sydney and how to configure a local Windows machine to act as the client. This is tricky because you can only connect to Ronin instances via ssh keys whilst on the Sydney network.

Read the [Server Configuration](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/yarra/blob/main/YarraServer.md) step first.

Then read  the [Client Configuration](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/yarra/blob/main/YarraClient.md).
